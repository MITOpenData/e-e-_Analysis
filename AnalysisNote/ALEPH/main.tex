\begin{abstract}
Two-particle correlations in high-energy collisions provide valuable information for characterizing Quantum Chromodynamics and have been studied previously for a broad range of collision energies in proton-proton (pp), proton-nucleus (pA), and nucleus-nucleus (AA) collisions. In AA collisions, a significant long-range angular correlation between particles was observed. The common interpretation of the results based on the hydrodynamics calculations was that a thermalized system was created in the AA collisions. Recently, similar correlation signals were observed in high particle multiplicity pp and pA collisions. The physical origin of the phenomenon is not yet fully understood. Due to the complexity of the hadron-hadron collisions, possible initial state correlations of the partons, such as those arise from color-glass condensate, could complicate the interpretation of the pp and pA data. Studies of high multiplicity $e^+e^-$ collision, where the initial kinematics of the collisions are well-controlled, could bring significant insights about the observed phenomenon. This paper proposes measurements of two-particle angular correlations of charged hadrons produced in $e^+e^-$ collisions, as a function of charged hadron multiplicity with the ALEPH detector. These measurements will enable a direct comparison between $e^+e^-$, pp, pA and AA collisions for the first time. Preliminary results from Belle open data are also presented.
