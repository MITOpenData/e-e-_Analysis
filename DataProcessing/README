Build w/ 'make'

Upon successful build, to process a Aleph file do
./bin/scan.exe <inFileName>

to clean do 'make clean'

For a simple test on svm (as long as the path is maintained) do
cp /data/flowex/MCsamples/1999/192/GGBB/DIR001/LEP2MCGGBBY1999E192_mctrue_aftercut-001.aleph .
./bin/scan.exe LEP2MCGGBBY1999E192_mctrue_aftercut-001.aleph 
root -l LEP2MCGGBBY1999E192_mctrue_aftercut-001.aleph.root

And check to see that the contents of trees are sensible
