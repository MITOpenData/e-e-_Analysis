Build w/ 'make' 

Upon successful build, to process a Aleph file do
./bin/scan.exe <inFileName>

to clean do 'make clean'

IF YOUR MAKE FAILS:
Most likely you have not source'd setStudyMultEnv.sh in the top level of studymult, setting a global variable used for compilation and clarity. Please cd to top level, source, and repeat

For a simple test on svm (as long as the path is maintained) do
cp /data/flowex/MCsamples/1999/192/GGBB/DIR001/LEP2MCGGBBY1999E192_recons_aftercut-001.aleph .
./bin/scan.exe LEP2MCGGBBY1999E192_recons_aftercut-001.aleph 
root -l LEP2MCGGBBY1999E192_recons_aftercut-001.root

And check to see that the contents of trees are sensible
