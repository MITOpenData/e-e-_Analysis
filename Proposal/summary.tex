\section{Summary}

The Belle open data has been used to measure angular correlations between
two charged particles. A hint of long-range ($|\Delta\eta|>2$) ridge-like structure at the
near-side ($\Delta\phi\sim 0$) was shown in the Belle data. The observation of
long-range near-side ridge like correlation (or the non-observation) with the full Belle data will make significant impact on the interpretation of the pp, pA and AA data.
