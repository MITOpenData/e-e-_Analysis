\section{Summary}

The BELLE open data has been used to measure angular correlations between
two charged particles. A hint of long-range ridge-like structure at the
near-side ($\Delta\phi\sim 0$) was seen in the BELLE data. The observation of
long-range near-side ridge like correlation (or the non-observation) will
bring significant impact to the interpretation of the pp and AA data.
