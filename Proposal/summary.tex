\section{Summary}

The Belle open data has been used to perform measurements of two-particle angular correlation functions for the first time. A hint of long-range ($|\Delta\eta|>2$) ridge-like structure at the
near-side ($\Delta\phi\sim 0$) was shown in the Belle data. However, the limited statistics precludes drawing firm conclusions and we propose to perform those measurements with the unique high statistics hadronic data recorded by the Belle detector.
