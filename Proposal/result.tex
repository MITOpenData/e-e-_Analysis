\section{Preliminary Results from Belle Open Data}

Figure~\ref{fig:multPID} shows the multiplicity distribution of identified particles (pions, kaons and proton) obtained after 
applying the selection on the particle transverse momentum (0.1 $<p_{\rm T}<$ 4.0 GeV/$c$). 
The dominant contribution to the total multiplicity is coming as expected from pions.
In Fig.~\ref{fig:multHadron}, the charged hadron multiplicity distribution $N$ is shown: the largest raw particle multiplicity observed in these events is about 70 before corrections for tracking efficiency, fakes and multiple reconstruction rates. Detailed studies with primary vertex and track quality are needed for the full Belle data analysis.

In Fig.~\ref{fig:ridgeBelle} the two-particle correlation functions from low- (N$>$20) and high-multiplicity(N$>50$) events are presented. 
In the low-multiplicity result, the dominant features are the correlation peak near $(\Delta\eta,\Delta\phi)=(0,0)$ for pairs of particles originating from the same jet 
and the elongated structure at $\Delta\phi\sim\pi$ for pairs of particles from back-to-back jets. To better illustrate the full correlation structure, the jet peak has been truncated.
Moving from low-multiplicity to high-multiplicity selection, the same-side jet peak and back-to-back correlation structures can be observed. 
However, in addition, a hint of ``ridge"-like structure is visible at $\Delta\phi \sim$0. This ridge has characteristics which are similar to the structures
observed in high multiplicity pp and pPb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ and in AA collisions over a wide range of energies.

To check if a long-range ridge structure exists, one-dimensional distributions in $\Delta\phi$ are obtained by integrating over different $|\Delta\eta|$ interval, 0$<|\Delta \eta|<$1 (left) and 
2$<|\Delta \eta|<$3 (right). In the left side plot, a near-side peak at $\Delta\phi=$0 and the contribution from the back-to-back jet at $\Delta\phi=\pi$ is observed, similar to what was observed in low multiplicity events. At large pseudorapidities, 
a hint of a ridge signal at $\Delta\phi=0$ is observed. This preliminary observation motivates a detailed study with the high statistics data taken by the Belle collaboration.
