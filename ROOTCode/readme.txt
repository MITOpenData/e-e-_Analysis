7. particles_on_thrust.c: For every given event, this file creates a thrust contour plot in theta-phi and plots the particles on top of the contour plot

9. randomcommands.c:

10. ridge.c: Plots the two particle correlation

11. ridge_ratio.c: Takes in two histograms and returns the ratio of the two (output is also a histogram)

12. ridge_tRotate.c: Rotates the particles in an event about the thrust angle and then performs two-particle correlation

13. scan_thrust.c: Takes in the ntuple containing px, py and pz and creates a new ntuple containing the theta and phi of the thrust angles of all the events

14. thrust.c: Calculates the thrust and plots the thrust contour lines
